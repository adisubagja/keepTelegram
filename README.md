## Motivation

In fact, I don't remember why I wanted to do this project. But the idea of a [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) clone in the Telegram is interesting, so I started working. Unfortunately, bots do not currently have the ability to send pending messages, so it is not possible to make reminders (at least on free hosting).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

2. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

## Fast usage

Just open the [bot](t.me/tgkeepBot) in _Telegram_ and start your work with it.

## Tests

I tried _Python unittest_ for the first time instead of [_pytest_](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and I like it. I give you the [link](https://github.com/mezgoodle/keepTelegram/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Test+Code%22) to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), where you can see all my tests.
