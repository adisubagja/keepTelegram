## Tech/framework used

**Built with**

- [Python](https://electron.atom.io)
- [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

## Features

With my bot you can **make** notes and **get** statistic of all time.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mezgoodle/keepTelegram.git
```

2. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Rename `.env_sample` to `.env` and fill the variables like:

```bash
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = <YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN>
DB_PATH=<YOUR_PATH_TO_DB>
```

4. Type in terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Fast usage

Just open the [bot](t.me/tgkeepBot) in _Telegram_ and start your work with it.

## Tests

I tried _Python unittest_ for the first time instead of [_pytest_](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and I like it. I give you the [link](https://github.com/mezgoodle/keepTelegram/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Test+Code%22) to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), where you can see all my tests.
